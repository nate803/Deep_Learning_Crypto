Train RNN ML Models for Crypto Currency
Use the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG) which attempts to use a variety of data sources to produce a daily FNG value for cryptocurrency. 
build and evaluate deep learning models using both the FNG values and simple closing prices to determine if the FNG indicator provides a better signal for cryptocurrencies than the normal closing price data.
